# Pokec_automation

This project is a completion of interview assignment. 
Main goal was to write 4 test cases to automate behaviour on [pokec.sk](https://pokec.azet.sk/).

### Versions

This project was developed and tested using the following versions:

* Windows 20H2
* Python 3.9.1
* pytest 6.2.2
* Mozilla Firefox 85.0
* geckodriver 0.29.0
* Selenium WebDriver 3.141.0

## Running Tests

To run the tests from the command line, run `python -m pytest --verbose --html="report.html"` from the project root directory.
This command will discover and run all tests in the project and create a report as html file when the execution ends.
